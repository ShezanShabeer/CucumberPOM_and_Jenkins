This is a UI automation project using Selenium-Java Cucuumber framework, to test the fuctionalities of an e-commerce website.
Here, I have developed and implemented test scenarios for user login-logout, searching product inventory and check order status.
Cucumber reports are generated for test run with screenshots for failures.
This framework is also integrated with Jenkins to allow periodic runs.
